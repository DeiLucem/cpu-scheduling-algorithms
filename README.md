# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Priority Algorithm (Prio)
Deadline Scheduling Algorithm
Preemptive Priority Algorithm (P-Prio)
Shortest Remaining Time First Algorithm (SRTF) 
Round Robin Algorithm (RR)

--> by clicking the "Add" button, a default Job object 
will be created. 

--> the "Save" button is used to save the changes 
made to the details of the Job.

--> you can delete the Job by clicking 
the "Delete" button.

--> after choosing the algorithm and having 
the job details all set, click "Run" to solve 
and compute for the turnaround time and
waiting time. A gantt chart will also be 
displayed at the top.
